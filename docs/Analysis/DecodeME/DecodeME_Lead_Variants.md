# DecodeME Lead Variants

As an initial analysis step, we apply [GWASLab's procedure for extracting lead variants](https://cloufield.github.io/gwaslab/ExtractLead/) to the DecodeME GWAS 1 data.  This procedure groups together significant genetic variants using a sliding-window approach, then reports the most significant variant in each region.



## Reproducing this
To reproduce the above-described analysis, run the [initial DecodeME analysis script][mecfs_bio.analysis.decode_me_initial_analysis]
