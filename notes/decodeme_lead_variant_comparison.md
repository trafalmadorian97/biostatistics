Let's compare the lead variants reported in Table 3 of the preprint with those [found by GWASlab ](/src/data_preprocessing_scripts/apply_gwaslab.py).

Additionally, lets compare the associated genes.  We can use regional plots generated by GWASLAB for context.

- 1:173846152:T:C: Present in both, but assigned to different genes.  GWASLAB associated with DARS2, which is right on top of the variant in the regional plot.   Preprint associates with RABGAP1L, which is downstream.
- 6:26239176:A:G: Present in both, but assigned to different genes. GWASLAB associates with H4C6, which is right on top of the variant in the regional plot.  Preprint associates with BTN2A2, which is some distance away in the regional plot.
- 6:97984426:C:CA: Present in both, but assigned different genes.  Can't see any genes in regional plot.
- 15:54866724:A:G: Present in both, but assigned different genes. GWASLAB associated with UNC13C, which is to the left on regional plot.  Pre-print associates with CCPG1, which is to rhe right oon regional plot
- 17:52183006:C:T Present in both, assigned the same gene CA10.  Only visible gene on regional plot.
- 20:48914387:T:TA Present in both, GWASLAB finds one of the two genes marked but the preprint. ARFGEF2 CSE1L are both downstream of the lead variant.
