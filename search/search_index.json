To date, most IBD genetic associations were derived from individuals of European (EUR) ancestries. Here we report the largest IBD study of individuals of East Asian (EAS) ancestries, including 14,393 cases and 15,456 controls. We found 80 IBD loci in EAS alone and 320 when meta-analyzed with ~370,000 EUR individuals (~30,000 cases), among which 81 are new. EAS-enriched coding variants implicate many new IBD genes, including ADAP1 and GIT2. Although IBD genetic effects are generally consistent across ancestries, genetics underlying CD appears more ancestry dependent than UC, driven by allele frequency (NOD2) and effect (TNFSF15). We extended the IBD polygenic risk score (PRS) by incorporating both ancestries, greatly improving its accuracy and highlighting the importance of diversity for the equitable deployment of PRS.</p> <p>Link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-023-01384-0</p> <p>Asset Link: Here</p>"},{"location":"Data_Sources/MECFS/DecodeME/","title":"DecodeME","text":"<p>DecodeME is a genome-wide association study of people with ME/CFS.

Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) had modest sample sizes, reducing their scope and reliability. Our study comprised 7,219 cases and 15,991 controls of European ancestry, constituting a new GWAS, a meta-analysis with a published GWAS and a replication study. We have mapped 43 susceptibility loci, including ten new associations. Assisted by dense genome coverage, imputation provided evidence for missense variants underpinning associations in eight genes. Other likely causal genes were established by examining associated alleles for cis-acting eQTL effects in a range of ex vivo immune cells. We found an over-representation (n = 16) of transcription factors among SLE susceptibility genes. This finding supports the view that aberrantly regulated gene expression networks in multiple cell types in both the innate and adaptive immune response contribute to the risk of developing SLE.</p> <p>Link: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4668589/pdf/emss-65418.pdf</p>"},{"location":"Techniques_And_Concepts/Heritability/","title":"Heritability","text":""},{"location":"Techniques_And_Concepts/Heritability/#definition","title":"Definition","text":"<p>Heritability is defined in the context of an additive genetic model.

Handbook of statistical genomics. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2019. Chapter authors are S. Burgess, C.N. Foley and V. Zuber</p> <p>\" A criticism of LD score regression is that every analysis for each pair of traits uses the same LD scores as the dependent variable in the regression model (and as LD scores have been precomputed by its proponents, literally the same LD scores are used in the majority of applied analyses). This means that any influential points in the regression will affect not only one LD score regression analysis, but all such analyses. LD scores are also likely to be a \u2018weak instrument\u2019 in the language of Mendelian randomization, as they will only explain a small proportion of variance in the dependent variable. Additionally, due to the scale of the data, it is not possible to provide a visual representation of an LD score regression analysis. Standard regression diagnostics are rarely, if ever, performed. Finally, results from LD score regression are not always consistent with known causal relationships; for example, the method did not find evidence for a genetic correlation between LDL cholesterol and CHD risk that survived a multiple testing correction (Bulik-Sullivan et al., 2015). The method has utility in mapping the genetic distance between related phenotypes, such as determining how closely related different psychiatric disorders are in terms of their genetic predictors (Cross-Disorder Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2013). However, the reliance of the method on numerous linearity and independence assumptions, incorrect weighting in the linear regression model (correct weights would require computation of the Cholesky decomposition of a matrix with dimension equal to the number of genetic variants in the model \u2013 misspecified weights are recommended for use in practice), and lack of validation against known causal relationships mean that results from the method should not be treated too seriously as an assessment of causality. \"</p>"},{"location":"reference/mecfs_bio/build_system/task/gwaslab/gwaslab_sumstats_to_table_task/","title":"gwaslab_sumstats_to_table_task","text":""},{"location":"reference/mecfs_bio/build_system/task/gwaslab/gwaslab_sumstats_to_table_task/#mecfs_bio.build_system.task.gwaslab.gwaslab_sumstats_to_table_task","title":"mecfs_bio.build_system.task.gwaslab.gwaslab_sumstats_to_table_task","text":"<p>Classes:</p> <ul> <li> <code>GwasLabSumstatsToTableTask</code>           \u2013            <p>Task to write a sumstats object to a plain table for further processing.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"reference/mecfs_bio/build_system/task/gwaslab/gwaslab_sumstats_to_table_task/#mecfs_bio.build_system.task.gwaslab.gwaslab_sumstats_to_table_task.GwasLabSumstatsToTableTask","title":"GwasLabSumstatsToTableTask","text":"<p>               Bases: <code>Task</code></p> <p>Task to write a sumstats object to a plain table for further processing.</p>"},{"location":"reference/mecfs_bio/build_system/task/gwaslab/gwaslab_util/","title":"gwaslab_util","text":""},{"location":"reference/mecfs_bio/build_system/task/gwaslab/gwaslab_util/#mecfs_bio.build_system.task.gwaslab.gwaslab_util","title":"mecfs_bio.build_system.task.gwaslab.gwaslab_util","text":"<p>Classes:</p> <ul> <li> <code>Variant</code>           \u2013            <p>Represents a genetic variant.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"reference/mecfs_bio/build_system/task/gwaslab/gwaslab_util/#mecfs_bio.build_system.task.gwaslab.gwaslab_util.Variant","title":"Variant","text":"<p>Represents a genetic variant.</p>"},{"location":"reference/mecfs_bio/build_system/task/magma/","title":"magma","text":""},{"location":"reference/mecfs_bio/build_system/task/magma/#mecfs_bio.build_system.task.magma","title":"mecfs_bio.build_system.task.magma","text":"<p>Modules:</p> <ul> <li> <code>magma_annotate_task</code>           \u2013            </li> <li> <code>magma_gene_set_analysis_task</code>           \u2013            </li> <li> <code>magma_snp_location_task</code>           \u2013            </li> </ul>"},{"location":"reference/mecfs_bio/build_system/task/magma/magma_annotate_task/","title":"magma_annotate_task","text":""},{"location":"reference/mecfs_bio/build_system/task/magma/magma_annotate_task/#mecfs_bio.build_system.task.magma.magma_annotate_task","title":"mecfs_bio.build_system.task.magma.magma_annotate_task","text":"<p>Classes:</p> <ul> <li> <code>MagmaAnnotateTask</code>           \u2013            <p>Perform the annotate step of the MAGMA pipeline.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"reference/mecfs_bio/build_system/task/magma/magma_annotate_task/#mecfs_bio.build_system.task.magma.magma_annotate_task.MagmaAnnotateTask","title":"MagmaAnnotateTask","text":"<p>               Bases: <code>Task</code></p> <p>Perform the annotate step of the MAGMA pipeline.
