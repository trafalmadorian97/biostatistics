Welcome to the ME/CFS biostatistics repo!
# Project goal
[ME/CFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myalgic_encephalomyelitis/chronic_fatigue_syndrome) is a common, poorly understood, and highly disabling disease.  This repository aims to facilitate scientific progress in the understanding of ME/CFS by maintaining code implementing the statistical analysis of ME/CFS datasets. Ideally, it should be possible to fully reproduce an existing analysis with a single Linux command, while modifying an analysis should involve tweaking only a few lines of Python code.
